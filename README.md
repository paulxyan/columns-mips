# columns-mips
A retro Columns falling-block puzzle game built in MIPS assembly using memory-mapped I/O for a bitmap display and keyboard input. Implements a full game loop with W/A/S/D controls, collision detection, and match-3 clearing (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) with gravity-style falling pieces.
